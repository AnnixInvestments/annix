## 1. Pipe Bending Requirements

### 1.1 Bend Ovality/Flattening Tolerances per B31.3

The difference between maximum and minimum outside diameters at any cross-section shall not exceed:

**For Internal Pressure Service Only:**
| Bend Radius | Max Ovality |
|-------------|-------------|
| ≥ 5D (5 pipe diameters) | 10% |
| = 3D (3 pipe diameters) | 21% |

**For Internal + External Pressure Service:**
| Bend Radius | Max Ovality |
|-------------|-------------|
| ≥ 5D (5 pipe diameters) | 12% |
| = 3D (3 pipe diameters) | 22% |
| = 1.5D (1.5 pipe diameters) | 37% |

### 1.2 Wall Thinning Tolerances per B31.3

After bending and forming, wall thickness shall not be less than the following percentage of nominal:

| Bend Radius | Max Wall Thinning |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ≥ 5D | 10% |
| = 3D | 21% |

*Note: ASME B16.49 specifies 12.5% max wall thinning for induction bends.*

### 1.3 Bend Wrinkling Tolerance

Depth of wrinkles on the inside (intrados) of a bend, measured from crest to trough, shall not exceed the nominal pipe wall thickness.

### 1.4 Longitudinal Weld Location

Pipe longitudinal welds shall not be located within 30° of the intrados (inside of the bend measured axially from the pipe centerline).

### 1.5 Minimum Bend Radius by Pipe Type

**Hot Induction Bending:**
- Standard: 3D minimum
- Extended radius: 5D recommended for high-pressure service

**Cold Bending (Pulled Bends):**
- 1.5D minimum for small bore (≤ NPS 4)
- 3D minimum for larger sizes

## 2. Flange Specifications

### 2.1 Flange Alignment Tolerances per B31.3

Prior to bolting up, flange faces shall be aligned within the following tolerances:

| Pipe Size (NPS) | Allowable Gap (in.) | Allowable Gap (mm) |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ≤ 4" | 1/32" | 0.8 |
| 6" - 8" | 1/16" | 1.6 |
| 10" - 14" | 3/32" | 2.4 |
| 16" - 24" | 1/8" | 3.2 |
| > 24" | 3/16" | 4.8 |

**Alignment Requirements:**
- Flange faces aligned within 1/16" (1.6mm) per foot of flange diameter
- Bolt holes aligned within 1/8" (3.2mm) maximum

### 2.2 Flange Face Finish Requirements

| Service | Finish (AARH) | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Standard (raised face) | 125-250 | Spiral or concentric serrations |
| RTJ (Ring Type Joint) | 63 | Machined groove |
| Soft seated | 250-500 | Suitable for sheet gaskets |

### 2.3 Minimum Fillet Weld Sizes

As required by B31.1 and B31.3:
- Socket weld fittings: min 1.09 × nominal pipe wall thickness
- Slip-on flanges: min 1.4 × nominal pipe wall thickness (inside weld)

## 3. Standard Pipe Sizes

### 3.1 Typical Pipe Sizes (NPS)

Standard sizes commonly stocked and specified:
- 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/4", 1-1/2", 2", 2-1/2", 3", 4", 5", 6", 8", 10", 12", 14", 16", 18", 20", 24", 30", 36"

### 3.2 Non-Typical Pipe Sizes

These sizes should be avoided unless specifically required:
- NPS 3/8" (use 1/2" instead)
- NPS 1-1/4" (use 1-1/2" instead)
- NPS 3-1/2" (use 4" instead)
- NPS 5" (use 6" instead)

*Non-typical sizes may be required for connections to equipment, sprinkler systems, and pipe jackets.*

## 4. Reducer Requirements

### 4.1 Maximum Single Reduction

- A reducer should not reduce by more than one pipe size in a single step
- For greater reduction, use fabricated reducer with maximum 60° included angle
- Eccentric reducers required for suction lines (flat side up for horizontal, flat side at centerline for vertical)

### 4.2 Reducer Installation

- Eccentric reducers: Install with flat side up in horizontal runs to prevent air pocket
- Concentric reducers: Use for vertical piping

## 5. Threaded Pipe Requirements

### 5.1 Threaded Nipples

- Schedule 80 minimum for carbon steel
- Schedule 40 minimum for stainless steel and alloys
- Same material as connecting pipe

### 5.2 Thread Preparation

- Clean, sharp dies reserved for specific material
- Apply appropriate thread sealant
- PTFE tape: 2-3 wraps in direction of thread

## 6. Expansion Joints

### 6.1 Installation Requirements

- Carefully handled to prevent damage to bellows
- Install with shipping bars/restraints removed only after final positioning
- Never exposed to torsional loads
- Properly anchored per manufacturer guidelines

## 7. Buried Pipe Requirements

### 7.1 Minimum Cover

- 30" (762mm) minimum depth of cover (top of pipe to grade)

### 7.2 Design Standards

- AWWA C200 Steel Pipe
- AWWA M11 Steel Pipe Guide for Design and Installation
